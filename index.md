    \abstract{
        This paper studies whether the interplay of social comparisons in housing and rising income inequality contributed to the household debt boom in the US between 1980 and 2007. We develop a tractable macroeconomic model with general social comparisons in housing to show that changes in the distribution of income affect aggregate housing demand, aggregate debt and house prices if (and only if) social comparisons are asymmetric. In the empirically relevant case of upward-looking comparisons, rising inequality can rationalize up to a quarter of the observed debt boom.

    Firm-borne Financial Contagion: When Rollover Risk Ripples
}{
    February 2024

    [[slides]](/assets/rollover-risk-ripples-slides.pdf)
    \abstract{ A financial network becomes more resilient to large shocks when it is split into two weakly connected components. A shock will be contained in the component of the network that it hits. This paper shows that shocks can travel across unconnected components if firms have multiple lenders and both short-term and long-term debt. Because of their short-term debt, firms are subject to rollover risk. When Bank $S$ does not rollover (withdraw) their short-term loan the firm might be forced to suspend its long-run debt service with its other lender Bank $L$. The roll-over risk ripples: a financial shock to one bank ($S$) travels to another bank ($L$), that need not be connected on the interbank market. I show that the shock will reach Bank $L$ if three conditions are satisfied. First, the firm's reliance on short-term debt must be in an intermediate range. Second, Bank $S$ provides a big enough share of the firm's short-term debt. And third, Bank $L$ provides a big enough share of the firm's long-term debt.}

    Understanding Housing Wealth Effects: Debt, Homeownership and the Lifecycle

    \abstract{Housing wealth effects---the reaction of consumption to changes in house prices---were at the heart of the Great Recession. Empirical and quantitative macroeconomic studies have found that housing wealth effects are stronger for more indebted households. One important policy implication is that lowering debt limits for borrowers will dampen the consumption slump in a house price bust. Such conclusions might be premature. We build a simple life-cycle model with housing with closed form solutions for housing wealth effects. We show that the strength of housing wealth effects crucially depends on the underlying household characteristics which also determine the debt levels. In this framework imposing one-size-fits-all debt limits does not necessarily mitigate housing wealth effects. To be effective, policies have to be tailored to borrowers' characteristics. Aggregate housing wealth effects can be reduced in three ways: (i) if old homeowners reduce their housing wealth; (ii) if the home ownership rate decreases; (iii) if agents have smaller houses. We provide a simple empirical test of our model predictions. When explaining housing wealth effects, we find that the level of mortgages turns statistically insignificant once relevant household characteristics (age and a proxy for housing preferences) are added.}
