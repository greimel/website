We develop a tractable macroeconomic model with general social comparisons in housing to show that changes in the distribution of income affect aggregate housing demand, aggregate debt and house prices if (and only if) social comparisons are asymmetric. In the empirically relevant case of upward-looking comparisons, rising inequality can rationalize up to a quarter of the observed debt boom.</i> </details> <br> <em>accepted at the <strong>Review of Financial Studies</strong></em> <br> <em>2020 WFA PhD Candidate Award for Outstanding Research</em> <br> <em>2022 Young Economist Award of the Austrian Economic Association</em> <br><br> <strong>Firm-borne Financial Contagion: When Rollover Risk Ripples</strong> &#40;February 2024&#41; <a href="/assets/rollover-risk-ripples-slides.pdf">&#91;slides&#93;</a> <details> <summary> [Abstract] </summary> <i> A financial network becomes more resilient to large shocks when it is split into two weakly connected components. A shock will be contained in the component of the network that it hits. This paper shows that shocks can travel across unconnected components if firms have multiple lenders and both short-term and long-term debt. Because of their short-term debt, firms are subject to rollover risk. When Bank $S$ does not rollover (withdraw) their short-term loan the firm might be forced to suspend its long-run debt service with its other lender Bank $L$. The roll-over risk ripples: a financial shock to one bank ($S$) travels to another bank ($L$), that need not be connected on the interbank market. I show that the shock will reach Bank $L$ if three conditions are satisfied. First, the firm's reliance on short-term debt must be in an intermediate range. Second, Bank $S$ provides a big enough share of the firm's short-term debt. And third, Bank $L$ provides a big enough share of the firm's long-term debt.</i> </details> <br><br> <strong>Understanding Housing Wealth Effects: Debt, Homeownership and the Lifecycle</strong> &#40;June 2020&#41; <br> with Frederick Zadow <a href="/assets/housing-wealth-effects-paper.pdf">&#91;paper&#93;</a> <a href="https://gitlab.com/greimel-zadow/public/builds/artifacts/master/raw/housing-wealth-effects/slides/slides.pdf?job&#61;compile_pdfs">&#91;slides&#93;</a> <details> <summary> [Abstract] </summary> <i> Housing wealth effects---the reaction of consumption to changes in house prices---were at the heart of the Great Recession. Empirical and quantitative macroeconomic studies have found that housing wealth effects are stronger for more indebted households. One important policy implication is that lowering debt limits for borrowers will dampen the consumption slump in a house price bust. Such conclusions might be premature. We build a simple life-cycle model with housing with closed form solutions for housing wealth effects. We show that the strength of housing wealth effects crucially depends on the underlying household characteristics which also determine the debt levels. In this framework imposing one-size-fits-all debt limits does not necessarily mitigate housing wealth effects. To be effective, policies have to be tailored to borrowers' characteristics. Aggregate housing wealth effects can be reduced in three ways: (i) if old homeowners reduce their housing wealth; (ii) if the home ownership rate decreases; (iii) if agents have smaller houses. We provide a simple empirical test of our model predictions. When explaining housing wealth effects, we find that the level of mortgages turns statistically insignificant once relevant household characteristics (age and a proxy for housing preferences) are added.</i> </details> <h2 id=talks_and_discussions ><a href="#talks_and_discussions" class=header-anchor >Talks and Discussions</a></h2> <p><em>2023</em>: <em>TU Vienna</em> · <em>Dutch Institute for Emergent Phenomena</em> in Amsterdam · <em>KVS New Paper Sessions</em> in Den Haag &#40;invited session, <em>cancelled</em>&#41; · <em>Austrian Economic Association</em> in Salzburg</p> <p><em>2022</em>: <em>T2M Conference</em> in London · <em>Behavioral Macroeconomics Workshop</em> in Bamberg · <em>Austrian Economic Association</em> in Vienna · <em>Tilburg University</em> · <em>Workshop on Redistributive Trends</em> in Amsterdam &#40;Co-Organizer&#41; · <em>4th Winter Meeting of the Austrian Economic Association</em> in Vienna</p> <p><em>2021</em>: <em>University of Vienna</em></p> <p><em>2020</em>: <em>AEA</em> in San Diego &#40;Poster&#41; · <em>AFA</em> in San Diego &#40;Poster&#41; · <em>University of Amsterdam</em> · <em>University of Bologna</em> · virtual meeting of the <em>Western Finance Association</em></p> <p><em>2019:</em> <em>Mannheim-Frankfurt Macro Workshop</em> · <em>Stockholm University</em> · <em>Nordic Macro Symposium</em> in Smögen &#40;Discussant&#41; · <em>Econometric Society European Meeting</em> in Manchester · <em>New Approaches for Understanding Business Cycles</em> &#40;CEPR, Mannheim, Poster&#41; · <em>European Winter Meeting of the Econometric Society</em> in Rotterdam</p> <p><em>2018:</em> <em>Financial Markets and Macroeconomic Performance</em> &#40;CEPR, Frankfurt, Poster&#41; · CEPR <em>European Summer Symposium in Financial Markets</em> in Gerzensee &#40;evening sessions&#41; · <em>Econometric Society European Meeting</em> in Cologne · <em>2nd Winter Meeting of the Austrian Economic Association</em> in Vienna</p> <h2 id=academic_positions ><a href="#academic_positions" class=header-anchor >Academic Positions</a></h2> <ul> <li><p><em>since 2024:</em> Assistant Professor – University of Vienna</p> <li><p><em>2020-2024:</em> Assistant Professor <em>&#40;tenure track&#41;</em> – University of Amsterdam</p> <li><p><em>2021-2024:</em> Candidate Fellow – Tinbergen Institute</p> </ul> <h2 id=education ><a href="#education" class=header-anchor >Education</a></h2> <ul> <li><p><em>2015–2020</em>: PhD in Economics – University of Mannheim</p> <li><p><em>2016–2017</em>: Visiting PhD student at Yale University</p> <li><p><em>2013–2015</em>: MSc in Economics – Institute for Advanced Studies &#40;IHS&#41;, Vienna</p> <li><p><em>2010–2013</em>: BSc in Economics – University of Economics and Business &#40;WU&#41;, Vienna</p> </ul> <h2 id=contact ><a href="#contact" class=header-anchor >Contact</a></h2> <p>University of Vienna <br />Department of Economics <br />Oskar-Morgenstern-Platz 1 <br />1090 Wien <br />Austria</p> <p>email: fabian.greimel@univie.ac.at</p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Fabian Greimel.
